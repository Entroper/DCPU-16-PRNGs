This is a library of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).  Currently
planned are a linear congruentrial generator (rand.dasm), TinyMT (a
modification of Mersenne Twister for resource-constrained machines,
TinyMT.dasm), and a block cipher or cryptographic hash generator.  The LCG is
recommended when performance is a concern.  TinyMT is recommended when the
quality of the random distribution is important, and the crypto algorithm is
recommended if the generated numbers need to be cryptographically secure.
